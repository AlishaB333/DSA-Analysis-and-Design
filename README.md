# DSA-Analysis-and-Design

For this course I was solving the problem of organizing the list of courses from a file into a data structure. I had to be careful to put each file line into the data structure
in such a way that that the user can search and print the course and it's prerequisistes. I used a Binary Search tree in my approach to the problem due to its efficient memory allocation
and the easy printing code c++ provides. Understanding the data structures is an important part of programming because you need to load data for use in the program no matter what.
Knowing the differences between them helps you determine what will get the job done with the least amount of memory consumption so your program can run smoothly.

I relied on our lesson examples and googling programming language strategies/code helped me overcome any issues I had with code when debugger. In particular Overstack and GeektoGeek were very helpful references.
I learned a lot through the assignments in this class, by writing psuedocode before writing the code I was able to organize my thoughts and structure my plan before ever touching Visual Studio.
I have gained a lot of experience with creating classes, class definitions, and structures, and calling back to them throughout the program. It makes my code more adaptable and I will definitely use these
assignments as an example in futures programs I write.
